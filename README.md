**Chatbot from Scratch**

**Project Description:**<br>
Mental health support chatbot made from scratch using different text preprocessing techniques, text vectorization using the bag of words method and an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to predict tag for user input text to provide a response associated with the predicted tag from the dataset.

**Skills:**<br>
1.	Natural Language Processing:<br>
•	Using the NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit) library.<br>
•	Text Preprocessing: Word tokenization, Lemmatization, Stopword Removal, Punctuation Removal.<br>
•	Sentence Vectorization: The Bag of Words method was used in this project to vectorize natural language texts.<br>
•	Sentiment Analysis: Use of an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to classify texts into various tags which were then used by the chatbot to generate a suitable response associated with that tag from the dataset.<br>
2.  Python:<br>
• Full project coding is done in Python in a Jupyter Notebook environment.<br>
• Used libraries like Json, Random, NumPy, NLTK and Tensorflow for various purposes:<br>
• Json: to read data from the json file and store it as a list of dictionaries.<br>
• NLTK: for different text preprocessing tasks like word tokenization, lemmatization, etc<br>
• Random: To choose a random response from a set of appropriate responses.<br>
• Tensorflow: Used methods like Sequential, Dense and Droput to build the ANN model and SGD method for stochastic gradient descent.<br>
• Used functional programming approach in the code, also used list comprehensions, operator overloading and other tricks in the code to keep the code more Pythonic and readable.
